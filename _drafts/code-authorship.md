You've just been hired by a company to join the team developing their flagship
software application. It's important work, and everyone is expecting you to
perform. They haven't assigned anyone new to this team in a while, so the
developers that are on the project already have a deep understanding of the
design. You really want to make significant contributions, and on your first day
you begin exploring the source code.

Soon you feel like you're in way over your head.

The code was developed using methodologies patterned after agile software
development. A significant number of the original developers have moved on, and
most of how the code works is "tribal knowledge". Documentation is minimal, and,
although the design is well thought-out, the code doesn't communicate clearly
the relationships between components, and the "voice" of the code is
inconsistent. Now its up to you to try and interpret how components are related
so that you can work on the project without badly breaking anything and having
to buy the team a box of doughnuts each week because you broke the build.

## Code Authorship

In agile software development, it is important to "multi-purpose". We don't
always have time to document every aspect of a software application.

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write
code that humans can understand. " - Martin Fowler
