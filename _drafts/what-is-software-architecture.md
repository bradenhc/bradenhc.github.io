"What does it take to become a competent Software Architect? Is there anything I
can do now to help me level up faster?"

These are questions I've asked myself on multiple occasions. And I know I can't
be the only one.

My previous understanding of what it took to become a Software Architect was
limited to a single primary driver: experience. But this seemed too passive to
me. Did I really just have to wait? There had to be something more I could do
now. So I began looking for a more proactive approach, and that's when I
discovered the Software Architecture Professional Certification from Carnegie
Mellon University.

Since completing the first course on the certification path, I've learned that
although experience is extremely important, it is only a small piece of the
puzzle. A combination of understanding and mastering knowledge, duties, and
skills all play a part in contributing to quality Software Architects. Time does
play a part in the process, but understanding how to most effectively spend the
time on developing the knowledge and skills required to become a competent
Software Architect starts with a proper education and practice.

My purpose then in this and following posts is to capture the essential
principles and practices surrounding software architectures. Summarizing what I
have learned will help me&mdash;and hopefully you&mdash;better understand three
things:

1. What it means to become a Software Architect
2. Why it is important
3. The skills and knowledge required to become one

I will present what I've learned as my answers to a series of questions that all
relate to a topic provided in the post title. I will attempt to keep the answers
as clear and concise as possible by engaging in less conversational and more
reportive rhetoric.

So without further adieu, let us begin!

## What is Software Architecture?

## What kinds of architectures are there? How do they relate?

## Why is Software Architecture Important?
