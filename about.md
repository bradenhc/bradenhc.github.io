Welcome! üòÅ My name is Braden Hitchcock. I'm a Software Engineer at Northrop
Grumman in Boulder, Colorado. I have a bachelor's degree in C.S. from Brigham
Young University, a master's degree in C.S. from Oregon State University, and
about 7 years of professional software experience under my belt. I'm passionate
about mastering software architecture, evolving legacy systems, and sharing what
I learn with others.

My goal with this site is to help elevate you so that together we can _innovate_
new solutions, _instruct_ each other on core principles, and _inspire_ each
other to become our best selves.

## Innovate

The software industry is fast-paced. Keeping up with it can be challenging. I
hope to make it easier for all of us to contribute to the innovations of the
future by capturing core principles of software engineering and documenting my
experiences with new technologies, standards, and practices.

## Instruct

We constantly digest new information, but do we ever make time to turn around
and share it with others? I hope to give back as much as I can by summarizing
the lessons I've learned while discovering principles of well-engineered
software systems.

## Inspire

One of the greatest achievements I could make is to be a catalyst of change. My
goal is to motivate you to try new things and improve your skills. To that end,
I hope that you will find useful insights and educational resources as you
explore this site!

## Here We Go!

Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll tune in occasionally to see what new
insights, tutorials, lessons, and technologies may be available on this site!
