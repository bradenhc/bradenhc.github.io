Welcome! üòÅ My name is Braden Hitchcock. I'm a software engineer at Northrop
Grumman in Boulder, Colorado. I have a bachelor's degree in C.S. from Brigham
Young University, a master's degree in C.S. with an emphasis in software
innovation from Oregon State University, and about 7 years of professional
software experience under my belt. I'm passionate about software architecture
and software evolution in space-based sensor data processing systems, and I look
forward to the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead!

My motivation for sharing my important experiences and insights through this
site can be summarized in the three words of my professional mantra: innovate,
instruct, and inspire.

## Innovate

I'm passionate about new software and technologies. The industry is fast-paced,
and keeping up with it can be challenging. I hope to be able to document my
experiences with new technologies as I encounter them on my journey towards
(hopefully) contributing to the innovations of the future.

## Instruct

My football coach/math teacher in high school (shout out to Coach Johnson!) used
to say that "you remember 93% of what you teach." By providing overviews of the
knowledge I gain over the years to come, I hope to not only provide a place for
others to learn, but also create a process that helps me remember what I will
learn.

## Inspire

The greatest achievement I could possible make is to be, as Dr. Danny Dig puts
it, a "catalyst of change" and motivate others to try new things and improve
their skills. I hope that you will find useful insights and educational
resources as you explore this site!

## Here We Go!

Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll tune in occasionally to see what new
insights, tutorials, lessons, and technologies may be available on this site!
