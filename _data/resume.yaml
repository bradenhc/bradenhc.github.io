about: >-
  I'm a husband, father, and avid coder specializing in software architecture. I
  love spending time with my family, serving in my church, exercising outdoors
  (especially running), and exploring the latest advancements in software
  engineering.
  <br/><br/>
  My experience focuses on the agile development of distributed systems that
  process space-based sensor data in real-time. I also co-lead a collective
  of engineers and product owners that lean forward in developing the next
  generation of systems that protect the U.S. and its allies.
  <br/><br/>
  My professional mantra is <strong>"Innovate. Instruct. Inspire."</strong>, and
  I'm always looking for opportunities that will allow me to contribute
  meaningfully in these three areas.
  <br/><br/>
